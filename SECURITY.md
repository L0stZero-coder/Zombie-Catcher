# Security Policy

1. Access Control
Only authorized personnel have access to the repository. Access is granted based on the principle of least privilege.
Use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for all users.
Collaborators must be removed from the repository when no longer required.

2. Code Reviews and Approvals
All changes must be reviewed and approved by at least one team member before merging.
No direct commits to the main branch; all changes must go through pull requests.

3. Dependency Management
Use dependency scanning tools to check for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
Regularly update dependencies and patch known vulnerabilities.

4. Secrets Management
Do not store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords) directly in the repository.
Use GitHubâ€™s Secrets feature or environment variables for sensitive data.

5. Issue and Vulnerability Reporting
Any security vulnerabilities discovered should be reported through GitHub Issues, labeled "Security" and marked confidential if possible.
All reported vulnerabilities are investigated promptly and fixed as a priority.

6. Monitoring and Logging
Monitor repository access and maintain logs of activity for auditing.
Review logs regularly for any suspicious activity.

7. Incident Response
If a security incident occurs, promptly revoke compromised access, identify affected systems, and notify relevant parties.
Document the incident and remediation steps.
